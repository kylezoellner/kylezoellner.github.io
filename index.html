        <p>Please note that for this assignment, we used our Student Virtual Machines to transmit the PHP Forms, but this GitHub repository 
            does not appear to support server-side languages. This means that the PHP data will not show up; the data that was given by the user 
            is formatted in a CSS-styled table in the actual assignment.</p>

        <p>A basic HTML/CSS Outdoors Mock Website. Per project requirements,
            the "Home", "Clothing", and "About Us" pages are the ones that work. The "Return Home" is at the bottom
            the Home page.
